# Cerium

**Cerium** is an AI-powered knowledge base built for engineering teams.  
It centralizes critical operational knowledge — Service Cards, ADRs, Runbooks, Postmortems — and makes it instantly searchable, accurate, and context-aware.

## What Cerium Does

Engineering teams often waste hours searching Slack threads, digging through Confluence, or re-asking the same questions to find information that already exists somewhere in the company.

Cerium solves this by:

- **Ingesting from your tools**  
  Connect Slack, GitHub, Jira, Notion, Confluence, and more. Cerium automatically pulls in relevant discussions, decisions, and documentation.

- **Organizing knowledge**  
  Knowledge is structured into service-linked cards and tagged by project, team, and source, making it easy to navigate.

- **AI-powered search & Q/A**  
  Ask natural-language questions and get permission-aware answers with citations — so you know exactly where the information came from.

- **Keeping knowledge fresh**  
  Cerium detects outdated runbooks, drift in service ownership, and stale ADRs, prompting updates before they cause incidents.

- **Accelerating onboarding**  
  New engineers can search for context, learn system history, and understand service architecture without constant human hand-holding.

## Why It Matters

- **Fewer repeated questions** → Engineers spend less time context-switching and more time building.  
- **Faster incident resolution** → The right runbook or past postmortem is always one search away.  
- **Reduced onboarding time** → New hires ramp up faster with self-serve, contextual knowledge.  
- **Improved knowledge retention** → Critical decisions and service history aren’t lost in old chat logs.
